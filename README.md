# Ants
Based on Plants vs. Zombies, Ants vs. SomeBees uses Object-Oriented Programming and principles to make a playable tower defense game complete with multiple subclasses of Ants. A Gamestate class is used to represent the overall gamestate, Place class for the "tiles" on the board, and Insect class for Bees, Ants, and all of Ants subclasses, drawing mainly on the concepts of Abstraction and Inheritance.
